NAME
    Catalyst::Helper::View::TT::Bootstrap::YUI - Generate TT templates using
    YUI

SYNOPSIS
    Helper for TT view. Creates the `MyAppView/TT.pm' file and a template
    directory structure under MyApp/root containing templates, macros, and
    links to the hosted version of the YUI `reset-fonts-grids.css' file.

    Use the helper to create the view module and templates:

        $ script/myapp_create.pl view TT TT::Bootstrap::YUI

    The stash key for configuring everything is `$c->stash->{page}' with
    defaults in `MyApp/root/site/shared/base.tt'.

    Add something like the following to the page templates for your
    application

     [%~
        page.layout = '2columns';  # use a 2 column layout (default is 'default')
        page.header = 'my_custom'; # will load root/site/header/my_custom.tt
        page.footer = 'none';      # don't display a footer

        # adds these <link rel="stylsheet"...> tags to the <head>
        page.head.stylesheets.push('foo.css','bar.css');

        # adds these <script> tags to the <head>
        page.head.scripts.push('foo.js','bar.js');

        # adds these <script> tags to the bottom of the <body> -- usually preferable
        page.body.scripts.push('baz.js','poop.js');

        # adds these classes to the <body> tag
        page.body.classes.push('foo','bar');
     ~%]
     ...your content here...

DESCRIPTION
    This helper module creates a Catalyst::View::TT class in your
    application. It also creates a set of templates, macros, and a
    stylesheet to let you focus on the content of your apps pages sooner
    with less copy and pasting.

    It also provides a mechanism for adding dynamic filters, for doing
    things like date formatting.

    If you already have a TT view in your application, make sure to include
    the other directives that are created by the helper. Typically, this
    file is simply `MyApp/lib/MyApp/View/TT.pm.new' if a file exists with
    the same name.

    See Catalyst::Helper::View::TT::Bootstrap::YUI::Manual for more details
    on available variables and macros, and how to work with the layouts.

  METHODS
    mk_compclass
    Generates the component class.

    mk_templates
    Generates the templates.
